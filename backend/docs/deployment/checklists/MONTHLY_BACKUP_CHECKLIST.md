---

## Month Start Preparation (Day 1)

### 1. Review Previous Month Performance

Analyze backup metrics from the past month:

- [ ] **Monthly Backup Success Rate**
  - Calculate: (Successful backups / Total backups scheduled) × 100
  - Target: > 99.5%
  - Command: Count daily logs: `ls -1 /var/log/chioma/backup-full.log.* | wc -l`
  - Action if < 99.5%: Document issues and create improvement plan

- [ ] **Monthly Restore Test Success Rate**
  - Check: Count weekly test reports
  - Target: 100% (all 4 weekly tests passed)
  - Action if < 100%: Investigate failed tests and resolve issues

- [ ] **Average Backup Duration Trend**
  - Calculate: Average of all daily full backup durations
  - Target: < 4 hours
  - Command: `grep 'completed' /var/log/chioma/backup-full.log | grep -oP 'Duration: \K[^s]*' | awk '{sum+=$1; count++} END {print sum/count}'`
  - Action if > 4h: Investigate database growth or resource constraints

- [ ] **WAL Archiving Reliability**
  - Check: `psql -U chioma -c "SELECT archived_count, failed_count FROM pg_stat_archiver;"`
  - Target: Zero failures (failed_count = 0)
  - Action if failures: Document root cause and fix

- [ ] **Storage Costs vs Budget**
  - Obtain AWS bill from previous month
  - Calculate S3 backup costs
  - Target: Within budget
  - Action if over budget: Review retention policies and optimize

- [ ] **Incidents and Escalations**
  - Review incident log for past month
  - Count backup-related incidents
  - Target: Zero critical incidents
  - Action: Document any patterns and create preventive measures

### 2. Team Capacity and Readiness

  ```bash
  psql -U drill_user -d chioma_monthly_drill << EOF
  -- Check all foreign key relationships
  SELECT DISTINCT
    kcu1.constraint_name,
    kcu1.table_name,
    kcu1.column_name,
    kcu2.table_name as referenced_table,
    kcu2.column_name as referenced_column
  FROM information_schema.referential_constraints rc
  JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage kcu1 ON rc.constraint_name = kcu1.constraint_name
  JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage kcu2 ON rc.unique_constraint_name = kcu2.constraint_name
  ORDER BY kcu1.table_name;
  EOF
  ```

  - All relationships should be intact
  - No orphaned records (if referential integrity enforced)

- [ ] **Verify Referential Integrity**
  - Check for orphaned property references
  - Check for orphaned agreement references
  - Verify all escrow records linked to agreements

    "SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan, idx_tup_read, idx_tup_fetch
     FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
     ORDER BY idx_scan DESC LIMIT 20;"
  ```

  - Verify critical indexes have scan statistics

- [ ] **Query Performance Sampling**

  ```bash
  # Time critical query
  time psql -U drill_user -d chioma_monthly_drill -c \
    "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM properties WHERE city = 'Lagos' AND status = 'active';"
  ```

  - Expected: Query completes in < 100ms

- [ ] **Full Table Scan Check**

  ```bash
  psql -U drill_user -d chioma_monthly_drill -c \
    "SELECT schemaname, tablename, seq_scan, seq_tup_read
     FROM pg_stat_user_tables
     WHERE seq_scan > 100
     ORDER BY seq_scan DESC;"
  ```

  - Identify queries doing unnecessary full table scans
